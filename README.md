The AGS file format is a data exchange format 
extensively used in GeoTechnical engineering.

Spreasheets are a core tool for a 
geotechnical engineer, and the fundamental idea is to
serialise out tabs, rows and cols into a format
for data exchange. It has a long legacy, is a bit
clunky bit it workz. This project will drag 
it into this century


ags2go is a toolkit that

- parses ags files
