ags2go
=======

The AGS file format is a data exchange format 
extensively used in GeoTechnical engineering.

Spreadsheets are a core tool for the 
geotechnical engineer, and the fundamental idea is to
serialise out tabs, rows and cols into a format
for data exchange. It has a long legacy, is a bit
clunky but it workz. This project will drag 
it into this century, and beyond.


ags2go is a toolkit that

- parses AGS files
- validates AGS files
- browses the AGS spec.
- and acts as a microservice for all of the above
