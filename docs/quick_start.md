AGS Quick Start
=============================

To understand AGS, one must loof at it froma geotechnical engineers
perspective, where a site is one of more  projects
think - bridges, rivers, sand, gravel roads
or railway embenkments and earthworks at the end of the garden
your own house subsidence and movements in a new house..

Spreadsheets and calculations basically
run a modern GEOTechnical capers..

AGS can be summarised by an

Engineer Investegation
========================
A Geotechincal ENGINEER .. vissits..

- Investagate plan vs site
- Want to know conditions of "materials"..
- anything from a new bridge
- to a problem with foundation in your house


Engineer Commision
=====================

An engineer would then request a 
GEoTechnical Investegation..
and wish to aqquire the materials
from a site,,
and take them away to test their properties..
Means a work crew handed down on the project


Sample Aqusition
=====================
This means aqquiring the samples..
inthe site
- the depths and 
- materials
- and temperature..

At the end the samples exists and
if u got one of them "van-lan"
then u can print out labels..
and if its connected..
send "data" to office in email and atachment..


GEO Engineer Results
=====================
Geo engineer can report ack the data for the project..
and probably monitor it as it goes on..
