// The open-geotechincal-ags ala `ogtags` handles parsing, validation, transformationv
// and manupulating within an API environment...
//
// The code consists of two parts
// - the AGS DataDict which is the definition of the data
// - and a Document, with its lines and structure
// - and serialising the data in an out.. and having fun with computers
// - and some more efficiency is saving.. whatever they may be.. ie reality vs IT..
//   Note to developers from Alex was u cant get a singnal under an ubmrella in pourungg rain,,
//   when there's a kinda flash flood.. Point taken (yes on railway also)
//
//
// The general idea is that at application launch, the data dict DD's are loaded
// and browsable via a www site (an alternate to AGS's site)
// and can also parse on the fly ags documents and convert them
// mainly into json atmo, for research and fun ;-)
